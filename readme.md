# Variational Deep Learning package

With this package we intend to offer a simple ready-to-use and extensible library for variational deep learning.

Please, keep in mind that everything is pretty much a work-in-progress.

    abstract = {Stochastic variational inference is an established way to carry out approximate Bayesian inference for deep models. 
        While there have been effective proposals for good initializations for loss minimization in deep learning, far less attention 
        has been devoted to the issue of initialization of stochastic variational inference. We address this by proposing a novel 
        layer-wise initialization strategy based on Bayesian linear models. The proposed method is extensively validated on regression 
        and classification tasks, including Bayesian DeepNets and ConvNets, showing faster convergence compared to alternatives inspired 
        by the literature on initializations for loss minimization.},
